# School_Projects
This repo contains some of the code that I wrote in my computer science program at Gustavus Adolphus College. 

Many of my projects are not listed here because I do not have access to them anymore. Some are because they were saved to my google account that no longer exists (i.e the jupyter notebooks from my machine learning course). Others because they were completed on local machines (i.e in my operating systems class we were changing the linux kernel on an old laptop provided by the college)
