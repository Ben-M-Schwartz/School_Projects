NAME
     cal - displays a calendar

SYNOPSIS
     cal [[month] year]
     cal -m month [year]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format.

     The options are as follows:

     no input
          Display the current month and year

     -m month
          Display the specified month of the current year

     -m month year
     or
     month year
          Display the specified month of the specified year

     year
          Display the specified year

     A single parameter specifies the year (1-9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: "cal 89" will not display a calendar for 1989. Additionally, the year must be 1753 or later to correspond to the adoption of the gregorian calender.

     Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a number
     between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by the current locale. For Example: 3, "March", and "Mar[any characters]" ignoring case will both function properly. "Morch" will not.

     Month and year default to those of the current system clock and
     time zone (so "cal -m 8" will display a calendar for the month of August in
     the current year).

     A year starts on January 1.

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX and later in BSD UNIX.
     The output of the cal command is supposed to be bit for bit compatible to
     the original Unix cal command, because its output is processed by other
     programs like CGI scripts, that should not be broken. Therefore it will
     always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain data. This extra blank
     line also appears with the original cal command, at least on Solaris 8
